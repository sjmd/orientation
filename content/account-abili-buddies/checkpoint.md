Another account-abili-buddy you can rely on throughout the course is the checkpoints.

These are opportunities for you to hold yourself accountable, by making sure you've completed the key steps in the Topic or Module you just experienced.

{{% icon checkered-flag %}}

I have...

- <input type="checkbox" class="checkpoint-checkbox" id="checkbox-1"> <label for="checkbox-1">Completed the Welcome Questionnaire ([here's the link](https://forms.gle/A2tDBHjAYb8R3ciC9)), or actively chosen not to complete it.</label>
- <input type="checkbox" class="checkpoint-checkbox" id="checkbox-2"> <label for="checkbox-2">Visited the SJMD Community and successfully logged in ([link](https://community.sjmd.space))</label>
