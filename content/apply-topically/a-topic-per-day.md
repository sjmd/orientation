While you are, of course, welcome to pace yourself however you'd like, we've designed the course with one cutesy rule:

**Within each of the main course Modules there are 7 topics. If you feel so inclined, you can pop in once a day, complete the topic of that day, then pop out.**

This will help you stay engaged, keep absorbing, and give you time to digest big ideas.
